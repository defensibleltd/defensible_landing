## Introduction

The Security Operations Centre (SOC) as we know it is a thing of the past. The SOC is not dead but is being reborn to avoid becoming obsolete. A SOC is an operational overlay of people, process, and technology built on your security model. When the environment and threat landscape changes, your security model must adapt and evolve, and so too must the SOC.

This operational overlay runs its own OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop. At its nexus is decision making. Decisions must be made rapidly. Supporting capabilities must evolve constantly. As the volume and velocity of your data and services multiply, so too do the digital surfaces that require protection.

Human and machine roles are shifting further towards their respective strengths, while still continuing to augment one other. Accelerating events are outpacing and overwhelming legacy architectures. On one side we are asked to do more with less, yet for human Security Operations (SecOps) to become sustainable, the irony is that we, as humans, must figure out how to do less with more. We must leverage new tools, patterns, and technologies to help us observe, orient, decide, and act faster.

Increased observability and better signals mean we can translate events to better outcomes. New hybrid strategies are emerging, ones that surveil ever more deeply and police ever closer to data sources. Those who can tame this growing complexity and velocity forge virtuous cycles not just for themselves but for their colleagues and teams.

Organizations also require this new protective overlay system to be antifragile, to improve and evolve ever more rapidly than before. Sentient attackers and digital contagion know no borders and continue to exploit human and machine vulnerabilities. As our information-rich circulatory systems pump digital value around an organization, how we respond to threats means the difference between keeping the lights on or thriving.

Cyber, as a domain of conflict, is one of the fastest-growing and accelerating spaces. It's one we all depend upon daily, one we can not afford to reject or ignore. For SecOps, there is increasingly no discrete or distinct center of operations. Resources, workflows, and defenses are elastic and unevenly distributed. So, as noble defenders, symbiotic with our technology, we must adapt to our new environments and realities.

The economics of defense are being rewritten once more. As always it comes down to the survival of the 'fittest'. Time is of the essence and trust is the fulcrum. The future is SOC-less, so what is it we should be optimizing for?

## Past

### On Measuring Security

Before we start, let's call out the elephant in the room, that of measuring 'digital' and security-related risk. There is a lack of agreed, standardized, and easily measured security metrics. Security is traditionally a negative sell prone to F.U.D. (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) mixed with snake-oil in little black boxes. Digital assets and services are malleable and perfectly replicable. This alters concepts like scarcity and intrinsic value. Security is a process. Security is a quality. Security is protection from harm and minimizing real rather than perceived risk. So what is it we are defending and why?

### Protecting Value

The digital realm supports real-world outcomes. We understand multiple types of value are produced and transit our organizations. Networks and systems weave the fabrics that provide the paths to value. This value can reside in silos (data at rest) but when in motion, is provided as flows for use by employees, contractors, guests, and customers.

Value is created and consumed. We endeavor to protect this value from threats and harm. Threats are real, observable, and arise from a wide range of actors and agents. Threats can be automated or manual, local or remote, sentient, or mindless.

Measuring digital security in a networked world is not unachievable, it just requires new and complex maths and metrics for factoring in transitive trusts. In the interim, we group and grade, scan and categorize, differentiate, record, and prioritize as best we can. At its core, I.T. is asset and change management and SecOps must facilitate change, not block it, for the macroorganism to survive.

### Taxonomy as Tax

To reason about assets, one has to identify the similarities and differences between each. For operations to attribute some semblance of risk; assets, events, and incidents require classification ratings. This enables the correct procedures or responses to happen. One size does not fit all, so there must be tagging and the differentiation between herds of 'cattle' and any sized cluster of 'pets' is a bone of contention. The earth, and indeed the network, is not flat. A single herd (monoculture) shares vulnerabilities and can experience common mode failures. A zoo with one animal per enclosure creates immense overheads and complexity, moving work elsewhere, away from prying eyes. Micro-segmentation of our example groups of animals is expensive and does damage to their health as is factory farming in a super lot. Neither are resilient.

Micro-segmentation actually results in more pets, not cattle. Just like the imaginary 'Push Me Pull Me', there is a difference between back-end homogenous command and control channels and front-end unique service paths. Our resources are limited and decision making depends on priorities, severities, classifications, and the grouping of similar attributes. Taxonomies are hard, they are a tax, a feature overhead, not a bug.

### Transitive Trust

A trusts B (A→B) but B trusts C (B→C) so now A implicitly trusts C (A→B→C). However, trust is not always an all or nothing proposition. Trust paths exist throughout code, interfaces, systems, networks, and people. These trusts are seen by some as vulnerabilities and often exploited by attackers.

Organizationally we move sliders between open and closed, trusted and untrusted. We apply guardrails, partition failure domains, and attempt to manifest protection policies. Flows are opened to provide access to value and facilitate collaboration. Authorized entities execute workflows based upon attribution of identity. We extend limited trust or default to no trust. We can refine trust to least privilege while moving workloads elsewhere. We also need to know when it is time to revoke trust especially as events accelerate.

Transitive trusts are the glue that holds society together. Zero trust, on the other hand, can be expensive and is usually reserved for high-risk untrusted environments though with increased automation, it is seen as a more secure starting position for many scenarios. The SOC itself has traditionally been a trusted nexus, one that shouldn't be beyond healthy forms of doubt.

## Present

### Volume and Velocity

At a macro level, the concept of a SOC is a system with inputs, processes, and outputs. It watches and controls aspects of another larger system, your organization. It is an OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop with interfaces that touch people, process, and technology. SecOps have the power to observe and control. The volume and scope of inputs in conjunction with the speed and accuracy of this OODA loop define the limits of your security observability and controllability.

Lifecycle management and the evolution of an organization mean that assets, interfaces, and systems change frequently over time. The traditional SOC was an inflexible stub with tightly coupled dependencies and point solutions. Onboarding new log stream formats or detection capabilities took days and weeks, rather than minutes and hours.

### Late to the Game

Security monitoring has traditionally been reactive, signature-based, and thresholds that generated events that roll up to dashboards leaving humans to attempt to figure out what's next. SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and playbooks were manually triggered and 'adhered' to by human operators and analysts. Scripts were run to slowly stitch together some semblance of situational awareness which left no time for proactive measures or prowling the shrinking perimeter.

### Burnout and Fatigue

Humans have an upper cognitive bound for processing information and symbols. Once exceeded we become ineffective, make mistakes, and require rest to reboot. We can not digest multiple information streams in parallel and are unable to manually refine raw data at scale. We can however create, write, and debug logic that fans out across wider surfaces (though some would argue not very well!). To have a security analyst manually responding to alerts including orienting and deciding what to do next is not scalable or realistic. Multiple analysts represent a common mode failure (they exhibit shared vulnerabilities) which then becomes a 'single' point of failure in the system.

Alert fatigue translates to false negatives and false positives. Further, a lack of agency to improve and control the system you're embedded in leads to burnout and churn. As things speed up, removing bottlenecks is key (and there's no room for any 'hero-complex'). The question then must be asked, where in the digital security OODA loop are humans fit-for-purpose and an asset, rather than a Mechanical Turk like liability? Far from considering humans to be widgets, it's time to take another hard look at the operational security activities that are best fit for our human reasoning and creativity.

---

## Change is Constant

Security is a continuous process in the face of ongoing internal and external change. If only for a moment, how would you take an accurate snapshot of the security of your organization? Would it involve a system-wide freezing of all states encompassing humans, processes, machines, interfaces, and all running code? This snapshot would be an ephemeral and fleeting state, almost immediately invalidated. Additionally, digital dependencies increasingly fall outside of the organization and are subject to multiple interwoven supply-chains. So, does total information awareness require omniscience and the total heat death of the universe, or can we learn to embrace change?

### Daedalus or Icarus

Infosec on one hand is learning from and leveraging useful DevOps approaches to automation and orchestration, yet attempts to give each host or service its own unique protection profile which creates more challenges. Micro-segmentation can work if everything is automated end-to-end, but then inspecting, maintaining, and troubleshooting this automation logic (and its own lifecycle) incurs additional overheads and operational ‘taxes'. There is a balance between open and closed, grouping, and segmenting. Supervising humans must still be able to reason about overall risk, trust, and dependencies, whilst retaining a veto on certain decision paths and resultant automated actions.

### Seeking Compliance

We know security is not compliance, and compliance is not security, but consistent and constant compliance form the bedrock that security teams require to build on and be effective. In the quest to protect an entity, can we actually prevent all harm (subject to constraints and available resources)? What is demonstrable for compliance sake and are there truly any acceptable losses or error budgets for security? If security teams could embrace internal and external regulatory requirements and constraints would this breed innovation? Most organizations seek to reduce overheads related to compliance while enabling an organization to adapt more quickly, but behavior change and process optimization tends to become harder over time (and even more so at scale). Adaptation, not just to threats, but to business needs, mean security itself needs to be more malleable when necessary and antifragile by default. Can security operations facilitate frictionless intra-team collaboration especially when asking other teams to demonstrate their own compliance?

### Practice, Profit, Power

Every organization is a target in some way. Your compute and data are worth something to someone somewhere, but who exactly? Connectivity has utility but what is this access worth. Threat actors include those learning and practicing their attack skills on your organization, those attempting to monetize you or your assets, and those using you as a stepping stone to other organizations (part of loftier geo-political power plays or nation-state goals). We like to try and steer clear of F.U.D. (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) but just as there is climate change and weather, there is IBN (Internet Background Noise) and those using connectivity to further their nefarious activities. Defending against two out of three is better than none out of three. When script-kiddies and criminals are automating at scale maybe we should be too.

### Jiu-Jitsu

If we make our organization robust but brittle it actually becomes less resilient to attack. It ossifies, unable to react, change, and adapt. If we constrain it too much, we are actually contributing to its demise. This is an undesirable outcome (and one we are fundamentally tasked to prevent). By optimizing for change, we optimize for culture and a technological fabric that allows for protection but is pliable enough to adapt. This adaptivity must also include our workflows, processes, and procedures. This is where the backbone of SecOps orchestration capabilities are key. With power and flexibility, loose coupling beats tight coupling. Speed and agility ensure better responses and outcomes, which result in increased survivability particularly during disruptive periods.

## Sliding Windows of Risk

Windows of exposure open and close. Minimizing risk in a shifting environment is an ongoing endeavor. It's not just managed assets in a private or public cloud at stake, there are physical access edges and user endpoints too. There are cameras and sensors, building management control systems and SCADA related enclaves. Devices may not all be managed by you, their flows may be controllable, at source, in transit, or maybe not at all. Differing zones and populations of devices grow and shrink. SaaS (Software as a Service) may be a clean consumption model but it's still someone else's stack. Constantly enumerating this morphing footprint of assets and services (while independently verifying it) is a challenge. Not everything auto-registers and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and Shadow I.T. don't count as Zero-Touch Provisioning! Ongoing asset and service discovery is a precursor for most forms of observability and detection.

### Ephemeral Echoes

In this new age of elasticity, hosts can no longer be counted on to be persistent and long-lived. Under the hood much is shifting, changing, and constantly migrating. More and more digital assets are ephemeral and intentionally so. This ephemerality might seem to raise the bar on both sides of the house, but as always, it depends. As we create more containers, we create more surfaces and boundaries to inspect. Attackers don't always seek or require a persistent foothold. If our ally rather than our foe, then we could close these sliding windows of risk faster and keep them shut. Opportunities involve tracking 'Best Current Practice' yet they are no longer centralized in IETF archives. Falling behind means continuing to repeat old mistakes. As always decisions are contingent on multiple factors and constraints. The underlying assumption (another elephant in the room) is that your culture, people, and process are optimized for, and ready for change. What is your SecOps team mean time for asset discovery and is it approaching → zero?

## Future

### A Virtual Core

The traditional SOC, as the sole nexus of security operations, is dissipating. The SOC doesn't exist as a point in time or space any longer. It is digitally and unevenly distributed. It's wholly virtual and focuses on ever more endpoints with larger service surfaces. It refines and reduces exponentially growing noise to stronger signals and concrete decisions. Automated actions are triggered by highly trusted workflows. Employees themselves are crowdsourced from and considered intelligent sensors, not lacklustre liabilities. The modern SOC is SOC-less, we're beyond the SOC, there is no physical center.

For many, there hasn't been a traditional SOC for some time. The new core is composable, highly scalable, and itself, introspectable.

### The Middle Way

SecOps is now a hybrid affair. It leverages increased observability, is almost wholly automated and is supported and augmented by real-A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) capabilities. It still retains highly valued human decision making and supervisory roles. Evolving detection engineering means a mix of more intelligent sensors at the edge feeding a scalable and elastic processing core. This can result in optionally more or less telemetry, but the fidelity required is higher, the representation of state, better. Grouping and zoning of assets are still required for these new architectures to facilitate decision making. Extracting features, correlating, clustering, and leveraging mutual information is faster. Impermanence is better understood and embraced within the security model.

### Security Observability

Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. In a security context this means whether we can infer the system (or entity) can still be trusted to perform integral and secure operations and/or that it has not been subverted or compromised in any way. We may use passive or active measures to try and establish this. We may query the entity directly or use side-channels, signals, and second-order effects. We may also apply this quality or property of observability to larger parts of our organization such as aggregate groups of hosts or network segments. The degree to which we can observe and infer the security state of a device is crucial to SecOps and relies heavily on detection engineering.

### Deceptive Detection?

One of the primary concerns is that we are dealing with an active and sentient adversary (or their agent) who wishes to evade detection. This means the state space may be being intentionally misrepresented to us which makes the detection task even more difficult. It's not just a case of trust via transparency, but the even harder problem of provable security. Encryption can also render parts and paths of a system opaque to us (without the correct keys or access) so SecOps may not always get the required visibility.

Sometimes relying on indirect means of establishing the state and integrity of a system or segment must be embraced. Digital lures and tripwires now play a greater role in detection as they give higher fidelity signals about the presence and intent of any malicious actors (they also generate low to no noise when strategically placed). This turns the tables on attackers and reverses an age-old asymmetry where the attacker now needs to detect whether they are engaging with valid assets are not. Their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are disrupted and paths more tightly constrained. Internal honeypots are not a new detection technology but have become more usable and yield greater returns in the 'kill-chain'.

---

## Wake Up and Stream

At any time an organization can be growing, shrinking, or temporarily in homeostasis. Employees, contractors, and 3rd parties constantly require provisioning, onboarding, and de-provisioning. SecOps must diminish any unknown unknowns and retain timely hooks into a range of organizational processes, silos, and systems. Where templated cloud instances can wake up (preloaded with tooling, agents, or sidecars) and immediately call home to self-register, there are other pockets, pools, and populations of assets that take longer to register. In the interim, these assets may be dark, unobservable, and non-controllable. SecOps still requires a mix of push and pull access to a range of endpoints for situational awareness and enrichment purposes. Whether it's maintaining security service accounts on other teams systems or rotating dedicated API keys, it's not just datacenter resources in play. Independent service and asset discovery will continue to fill in the blind spots. Spurious firewall and routing changes, cowboy cabling, errors and omissions, B.Y.O.D. and shadow I.T. all mean your footprint may not be as clear-cut as a discrete range of AWS NETBLOCKs. Constant enumeration means a mix of active scanning capabilities and the ability to poll or update multiple registries and systems of record.

---

## CI/CD/CS

Continuous Improvement (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) have changed the game for developing and deploying applications, systems, and platforms. Implicit in the concept of CI is Continuous Security (CS) but this is not always the case. DevOps (Developer Operations) merges the roles and best practices of each previously distinct team. In a nutshell, those who make the thing are responsible for operating the thing (and best placed to quickly diagnose and fix the thing). Infrastructure and configuration also become managed and orchestrated as code (where possible). Software development practices and pipelines leverage tighter revision control, better testing, and automatic deploys to accelerate the 'shipping' and evolution of products and services.

This approach also helps to minimize risk and spot errors more quickly. Although the cadence increases, the magnitude and impact of each change is theoretically lowered, and feature velocity increases for consumers. Risk is also assumed to be lowered but only if security observability increases and mitigation occurs quickly. SecOps can also apply this approach to its own platforms, not just to the assets and channels it protects. Detection logic, platform operations, and workflows are all represented as readable and malleable code that's version controlled. Yet once risk is identified, the burden of classifying, tracking, and mitigating risk lands in different places depending upon the organization.

---

## C\&C Monoculture

Security operations exist as an overlay, of another services overlay, your organization. How do we ensure we mitigate the risk we ourselves may inject? Just as backup and malware software agents run with escalated privileges and create new attack surfaces, we must walk a fine line between connecting everything back to SecOps platforms with excessive privileges. Whether pushing and pulling, across trusted or untrusted fabrics, to managed or unmanaged endpoints, have we just created a new but ubiquitous attack surface for all our assets? It depends. There is an implicit assumption that security engineers and security operations platforms are more secure than 'regular' engineering and operations. Writing secure code is a hard problem. Building secure systems is even harder, as is maintaining trust. We must not forget to get our own house in order before pontificating to others about risk!

We also face a 'Portfolio Problem' where no single supplier can provide Best-in-Class (Best-in-Breed) solutions across all functional requirements for a modern SecOps practice. Cherry-picking security platforms and providers means a more heterogeneous environment, one that's connected with open standards, one that understands ecosystems and the value of secure flows. This then results in your security workflow logic becoming your secret sauce, as it is unique to your organization, just like a fingerprint. Sustainable and resilient SecOps must focus on composability built atop of an API first mindset. This also means first-class APIs (rather than a hastily cobbled-together afterthought).

---

## Not All Developers

New terms like SecDevOps assume internal developers write all tooling. Not every organization produces software, many just purchase and consume it. For some, internal tooling teams are a luxury though increasingly a basic requirement. Many wrestle with vendors and procurement yet all SecOps are, at a macro level, composing security services. Be it using rented cloud services or SaaS (Software as a Service), to consuming or offering these services via an API. 'Build or buy' may be the catch-cry but you still can not outsource your own risk, so whether you have the budget and resources or not, architecting and at least orchestrating your own macro security processes and workflows is crucial. This is the malleable logic that must be encoded and gotten right. It may start with an analyst, engineer, or manager, but low and no-code visual workflows do not require software engineering capabilities. Automation is increasingly accessible to all levels of expertise and required to overcome modern SecOps challenges.

---

## Idempotent Workflows

Where and how does our security logic evolve from? Ultimately we are outsourcing an increasing amount of compute stack management while moving closer to writing our own high-level application or business logic. We are writing in a more declarative way about our intent and desired outcomes. This is also where SecOps is moving towards. We are focusing on the workflows that leverage a range of specialized services and tools. We are shifting towards composing repeatable outcomes riding on top of trusted and untrusted fabrics. Consistent and integral responses are required not just from APIs but from our workflows. They should result in deterministic outcomes stemming from the same decision trees. Can you smoke test your security workflows end-to-end and easily simulate events that lead to an incident? Rather than waiting for an attacker or point in time penetration test, can you drill your digital procedures for consistent outcomes and adjust where necessary?

---

## Manual or A.I. Ops?

A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) has utility. It is not a panacea. The human fear of obsolescence mixed with rampant A.I. washing in the industry has resulted in hyper skepticism. This doubt is warranted and should be welcomed by vendors offering real-A.I. We already use A.I. daily in everything from search engines using NLU (Natural Language Understanding) and deep learning to EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) malware detection. A.I. is ambiguous, it's an umbrella term for a set of technologies that mimic human intelligence. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are subsets with very useful applications, especially for certain problem spaces. Labeled data is commonly used in supervised learning (network protocols are well-labeled datasets). Unlabelled data is used in unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning uses rewards to constantly calibrate. The machine learning domain is vast and unfolding rapidly. Spotting real-A.I. versus snake-oil is a challenge but not an insurmountable one. Many fear the black box due to a lack of introspectability and explainability, so the power to surface raw datasets, features, and intermediary states, become the transparency challenge for engendering trust. A.I.-Ops provides a faster and more scalable OODA loop, but one that must overcome the trust issues that IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) faced when compared to IDS (Intrusion Detection System). Who is ultimately accountable and responsible for decision making and any resultant negative outcomes? There is a logical evolution from manual tasks, to automation, and then to augmentation and enhancement using A.I. SecOps is already an artificially enhanced and intelligent OODA loop, so the question is not when, but how much will we allow A.I. to drive?

---

## Bridging the Gap

There are no economies of scale if your team needs to grow linearly with the number of assets managed. Such a situation is not sustainable nor efficient. There is already a talent gap in Infosec and it's set to worsen. Freeing up human creativity from being stuck on security toil empowers teams to be more forward-looking, proactive, and nimble. A constrained talent pool means fewer people to deal with growing process and technology. This in itself becomes unsustainable without using force-multipliers such as smarter tools, automation, adaptable processes, and real-A.I.

SecOps may not manage all digital assets but must be able to at least observe them and investigate when necessary (including retrospectively). These activities all require orchestration and reach. Ever more complex logic and decision making must be executed rapidly, fast enough to identify and protect against an attacker's automation. There is an urgency that necessitates distributed human and machine OODA loops, both for incident response and threat hunting. Humans will continue to create and supervise, but may need to manage and operate less.

---

## The Meta-Security OS

People still make the most important decisions. Optimizing for the 'correct' or best decisions means optimizing around people. The human role in digital security is still manyfold and although certain forms of pattern recognition are best left to machines, others are not. Organizations primarily run on a meta-operating system composed of people, called culture. It's constantly patched, re-written, rebooted, sometimes vulnerable, but ever-evolving. To optimize for resilience and antifragility is to invest in people and culture. Where resources, skills, and experience are lacking, fostering a culture of constant learning and psychological safety is the best hedge against future risks. This is how one secures optimal outcomes.

## Final Thoughts

One size does not fit all. Model, adapt, and store your security workflow logic as code. Ensure it can be iterated on and evolved quickly - as this is your secret sauce, your domain-specific language, and your customizable OODA loop.

**Automate and assure.**

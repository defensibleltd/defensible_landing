**Note:** I started somewhat in reverse, thinking about catchy titles and tried to deprecate the use of the term "DDI" and leave "Micetro" out of H1 titles (as those searching for Micetro already know something about Micetro). Also wanted to not have TLAs (or FLAs) in the title as much as possible (other than **IPAM** which is more well known). I wonder if we could mix and match the below as H1s and H2s but they're definitely going to be the "hook" in to actually reading or engaging with the thing... e.g. this is also where humour could play a role especially if targeting **Reddit** ads or **social media** with something "fresh"!

## The "Tipping Point" Series Idea (Microlithic / Faster?)

**Note:** Rather than one monolithic document (and keeping "PathFactory" + agility in mind!), am thinking about a fast series of 1 pagers that speak to the "tipping points" for 'blah'. This means we are helping engineers and managers know not just what, but when. As you state, many are SMB/SME and the biggest competitor is a spreadsheet or OSS, so let's lay out a path for them and play on their own pain points and point of need. Additionally, the idea of "Controlling your ROI" which changes as your future does which might get us away from figures a little e.g:

Pattern:

* Main heading (H1): The Tipping Point for "BLAH"
 * Subheading: Futureproof, Grow, and Control Your ROI

E.g:

* The Tipping Point for IPAM
  * Futureproof, Grow, and Control Your ROI 
* The Tipping Point for an Overlay DDI
* The Tipping Point for DDI Automation
	* ...
* The Mircosoft Tipping Point for Overlay DDI
  * Futureproof, Grow, and Control Your ROI 
    * IPv6, forests, zone limits, endpoint config
* The Amazon AWS Tipping Point for Overlay DDI
* The Multicloud Tipping Point for Overlay DDI
* The Security Tipping Point for Overlay DDI
* The Engineers Tipping Point for Overlay DDI
  * Uptime, errors, toil, quality of life, career, oncall, security
* The Managers Tipping Point for Overlay DDI

**Note:** Each of the selected titles could also form a "path", compliment each other, and branch off with separate CTAs for engineer, manager, IPAM overlays, Microsoft shop, AWS shop, hybrid/multicloud etc.

> "Every business reaches a tipping point where asset management stops being a nice to have and starts being business critical. Physical and virtual assets multiply, move, and morph requiring tracking, management, and allocation. Accountability and responsiblity for assets equally maps to the digital domain where IP addresses, VLANS, identities, and tokens support services and operations...",

**Note:** I need to get my SEMRush account and access upgraded w.r.t. MenAndMice info + keyword statistics again.

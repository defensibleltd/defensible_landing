# Incumbents / Alternatives

There are 2 main *native* alternatives i.e. Excel and the default Microsoft IPAM

# Why use Micetro vs Mirosoft IPAM
* Single global IPAM across multiple forests e.g. multiple prod, multiple test (ask Lauren)
* Future-proofed overlay that is DNS and DHCP agnostic
* Fine grained RBAC (over and above configuring limited GPOs)
* Choice of database (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL)
* Centralized auditing and logging (without additional configuration of servers)
* No limits to numbers of DHCP servers, scopes, DNS servers, or zones.
* Utilization and trending across both IPv6 and IPv4
* Next free address across IPv6 and IPv4
* Discovery and scanning of IPs across routers and switches

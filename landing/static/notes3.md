There are 3 main *native* alternatives i.e. Excel, default Microsoft IPAM, Solarwinds

# E.g. Why use Micetro vs Microsoft IPAM
* Single global IPAM can be used across multiple forests e.g. multiple prod, multiple test 
* Future-proofed overlay that is DNS and DHCP agnostic
* Fine grained RBAC (over and above configuring limited GPOs)
* Choice of database (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL)
* Centralized auditing and logging (without additional configuration of servers)
* No limits to numbers of DHCP servers, scopes, DNS servers, or zones.
* Utilization and trending across both IPv6 and IPv4
* Next free address across IPv6 and IPv4
* Discovery and scanning of IPs across routers and switches

# IDC Report Highlighted Incumbents

* Solarwinds
* Spreadsheets (Excel)
* Open Source IPAM? (Which one: Netbox, NPIP, phpIPAM?)

**Note:** There's a lot to dig in to in the IDC report!

Hi, I've been reviewing docs, web, and starting to crystallize some thinking.
<br>
<br>
**TL;DR:** I need a little more time to digest + come up with something solid (I know you are on PTO Tue 17th - Fri 20th Oct this week). The below is where I am currently at. I keep coming back to your basic requirements mixed with some of my own digging and the perceived "dryness" of the segment/industry (and also that **ROI** implies **dollar** figures!) Not sure how we can even allude to objective "cost savings" and "payback time" other than at least 1 customer giving us some quotable numbers around savings or billable time / headcount reduction. It should be noted that _EfficientIP_ seem to have taken down their ROI calculator (albeit their whitepaper speaks volumes). They had 50 surveys across their customer base with ROI calculated over a 3 year period. I wonder if we can find other, and more neutral sources for numbers (maybe just use aspects of the IDC report)?

# Audience

* **Persona**: technical/trusted advisor persona engineer/architect 25-45yrs old (5+ years exp.) but also something for the manager/buyer 40-55yrs persona (ROI, talent retention, streamlining)
* **JTBD**: Jobs To Be Done -> Asset Management, planning/designing address space, IP admin/management/provisioning (orchestration), automation, user/server/IoT edge, multicloud/hybrid footprints etc. 
* **Geo**: North America
* **Buyers Journey**: Awareness and/or consideration stage?
* **Org Persona**: 
  * 100-1000ppl (SMB/SME), < 10k active IPs, any vertical/sector
  * Orgs with more dynamic networks and a higher cadence of change (more static = manual methods, more change = pain points/opportunity)
* **SEO/Keywords**: 
  * Ad hoc research of use of term 'DDI' in #neteng groups (spoiler: hardly known/used and mainly vendor/Gartner created jargon however IPAM is well known!)
    * this runs counter to the IDC / Bluecat paper asking an existing customer base about familiarity with the term
    * presumption is we want to reach **net new** logos, right?
  * Long term ROI on content/titles (should be webified and indexable)
* **Content**: 
  * Primarily Microsoft and IPAM focused
  * Lean in to ROI with quantitive/objective metrics (without doing much novel research/interviews?)
  * **Differentiated value** (e.g. vs Excel, MS IPAM, Efficient IP, Infoblox, etc)
  * Highlight features like network discovery, reporting, and IPv6 support that other alternatives don't do/have
  * But, it's still mainly an education piece on not just the ROI of IPAM, but the ROI of Micetro?
* **Levers/emotional touch points**: 
  * "control" standard which works by highlighting existing lack of control(s)
  * "next step" career wise, champion, aspirational, personal  
  * "efficacy/efficiency" time-to-value / acceleration of tasks
* **Benefits**:
  * Unified views, fresh not stale data, less errors, better outcomes.
  * Ease of deployment, coverage, and management
  * Faster provisioning of IP assets and services (more time for other higher impact work)
  * Automation with standard REST APIs across all assets versus UI or PowerShell
  * No additional training required
  * Rapid integation with other ticketing and workflow platforms and projects 
  * "Meets you where you are and helps you get to where you need to go"
  * Technology agnostic and futureproof
* **Issues/Objections**:
  * IPAM is optional and not business critical
  * IPAM involves licensing
  * Cost effective compared to what? 
  * Why Micetro vs EfficientIP?
